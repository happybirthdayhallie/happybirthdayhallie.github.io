    Congratultions, you have acheived the monumental accomplishment of passing time! <br>
    There's more to it of course. For instance, since your last birthday, you have <br>
    done nontrivial things, such as going to college, and clicking on the link to <br>
    an awesome birthday website. There's gotta be more though; it <i>has</i> been a year...
    <br>
    <br>
    <i><strong><h3>Presenting...</h3></strong></i><br>
    <h2><strong>Things that've statistically happened since your last birthday!</strong></h2>

    <ul class="happen">
      <li>You travelled 939,885,431,000 meters relative to the sun!</li>
      <li>You sent 5,840 snapchats!</li>
      <li>The DOW has gone up 3455 points! (Take credit for this)</li>
      <li>You sent 24,264 text messages!</li>
      <li>There are 208,837 more wikipedia articles!</li>
      <li>1.6 Million dogs were adopted from shelters!</li><!--Don't ask how many were euthanized-->
      <li>You produced 360 liters of saliva!</li>
      <li>The Korean War officially ended!</li>
      <li>And more!</li>
    </ul>

    Now, dwelling on the past is fun and all, but why not take a look at what we're<br>
    gonna make happen in the <strong>next</strong> year?

    <ul class="happen">
      <li>Beekeeping</li>
      <li>Bee Simulation</li>
      <li>Uh...</li>
    </ul>

    Who knows what the future will hold? All I can tell you is that it's going to <strong><i>bee</i></strong> an awesome year.
